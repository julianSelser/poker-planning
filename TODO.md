- check wtf is up with the openssl error, now fixed with:  `--openssl-legacy-provider start` in `package.json`
- handle case in frontend where room doesnt exist (server says roomId is a nono, basically connect/disconnect handlers)
- refactor backend to use proper model
- rename user to player
- handle key prop correctly in Board.js for users, its using username which fkn sucks
- css (check microsoft guidelines for using in teams meet app)
- deploy shit somewhere on cloud
- deck of cards should be changable via combobox to use schemas other than fiboanacci
- reveal should become hide
- reset votes
- clear card
- script for running, both for prod and for local dev
- usernames can be duplicated, dont allow
- move items service into module
